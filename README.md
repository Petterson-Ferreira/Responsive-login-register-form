## Login e register form with sliding animation using HTML, CSS and JS.
it's just a responsive front-end project, I didn't do the form validation (I was going to start but that's not the intention here).

### How it works
We have 2 forms and 1 ::before element which is the circle.
When we click on sign up or sign in button the form change swtich screens by throwing it to the side.
JavaScript add and remove a class when sing up or sign in is clicked telling to CSS to change state.
